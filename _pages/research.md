#### Research in Distribution Estimation

*Distribution estimation* concerns the problem of estimating an unknown *probability distribution* from a finite set of samples. The *empirical estimator*—equivalently, the *maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)*—is known to be *asymptotically optimal*. However, alternative procedures such as *add-constant estimators*, the *modified Good–Turing estimator*, and the *profile maximum likelihood (PML) estimator* can demonstrate improved performance under various choices of *loss functions*. These estimators are *natural*, in the sense that they assign equal probability to symbols that appear the same number of times in the observed sample.

In our work, we characterize the *unavoidable estimation error* incurred by the class of natural estimators. We further develop strategies that leverage some *side information* to beat the performance of natural estimators.
