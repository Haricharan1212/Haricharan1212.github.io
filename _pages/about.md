Hey, I'm **Haricharan**! I'm a final-year Electrical Engineering dual degree student at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

I'm deeply passionate about researching in *Electrical Engineering* and *Computer Science* using mathematical principles. In particular, I'm excited about the subtle interplay of learning, optimization, and information theory. My research interests are two-fold:
- *Advancing statistical learning and estimation to better characterize data-processing mechanisms:* I aim to develop learning methods and rigorously establish their performance guarantees and information-theoretic limits.
- *Investigating how optimization enables effective inference from observations:* I intend to examine how optimization algorithms interact with statistical models and establish their convergence and risk bounds.
