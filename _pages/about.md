Hey, I'm **Haricharan**! I'm a final-year Electrical Engineering dual degree student at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

I am deeply passionate about exploring advanced concepts in *Electrical Engineering* and *Computer Science* using mathematical principles.

My primary areas of interest include:

- *Statistical Learning* and *Information Theory*
- *Theoretical Computer Science*, with a particular emphasis on algorithms and complexity
- *The Future of Communication Systems*, including 5G and 6G technology

I find great intellectual satisfaction in *tackling challenging problems*, whether they are engaging mathematical puzzles or intricate research questions.
