Here are three packages with which we can generate really cool, picture-perfect (excuse the pun), and crisp technical diagrams.</p> <h2 id="tikz">TikZ</h2> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TikZ</code> package is arguably the most important among the three, and indeed the other two packages which I will mention are built on top of this. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TikZ</code> is the front-end for an even more bare-bones packages called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgf</code>. It’s usually used to plot graphs (the graph theory kind), and sometimes actual graphs also (the one with X- and Y- axes).</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tikz_image-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tikz_image-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tikz_image-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/tikz_image.png" width="300" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>The above image was made entirely in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TikZ</code>- it looks very cute.</p> <h2 id="circuitikz">CircuiTikZ</h2> <p>Yes, this had to be done.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\vec a \times \vec b\) gives us the area of the parallelogram with sides along \(\vec a\) and \(\vec b\).</p> <p>For a triangle with coordinates at \(\vec p_1 = (x_1, y_1), \vec p_1 = (x_2, y_2), \vec p_1 = (x_3, y_3)\), the area would be half the area of the parallelogram formed by \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_2\) and \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_3\), which is:</p> \[A_{123} = \frac 12 mag((\vec p_1 - \vec p_2) \times (\vec p_1 - \vec p_3)) = abs \frac 12 \left ( (x_2 - x_1) (y_3 - y_1) - (y_2 - y_1) (x_3 - x_1) \right )\] <p>This can be written succintly as \(\boxed{ \frac 12 abs \left ( \sum_{i = 1} ^ 3 x_{i} y_{i + 1} - x_{i + 1} y_i \right )}\), with the indices wrapping modulo \(3\) (i.e. \(x_4 = x_1, y_4 = y_1\)).</p> <p><em>Note:</em> we will assume throughout that \(x_{n + 1} = x_1\), i.e. indices wrap modulo \(n\).</p> <hr/> <h4 id="area-of-a-polygon">Area of a polygon</h4> <p>A natural suggestion for the area of a \(n\)-sided polygon might be this:</p> <ol> <li>Divide up the polygon into triangles. This division will be of the following form: We pick a “base point” say \(\vec p_1\), sort the points in anti-clockwise order of their angles from the fixed base point and iterate over the base line, which would be the line joining \((\vec p_2 \text{ and } \vec p_3), (\vec p_3 \text{ and } \vec p_4) \dots (\vec p_{n - 1} \text{ and } \vec p_n)\) respectively.</li> <li>Sum up the areas of each of the triangles</li> </ol> <p>This seems reasonable but has a slight caveat. It works only for convex polygons. In case of concave polygons, we might be overcounting the areas!</p> <p>Now, let’s think about the ominous \(abs\) at the front and try to tackle it. Let’s just remove the \(abs\) and see what it really means. It just means that we’d take the signed area, i.e. the order in which we take our vectors matters! This would work only if \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_2\) and \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_3\) are anti-clockwise in order for each of the polygons.</p> <p>In the off-chance that \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_i\) and \(\vec p_1 - \vec p_{i + 1}\) are clock-wise, that can only indicate non-convexity. But in that case, we would want to subtract the area anyways! So our signs are accounted for, and we’re golden.</p> <p>Finally, our area is (\(S_{ijk}\) indicates the signed area of the triangle formed by the points \(P_i, P_j, P_k\)):</p> \[S = S_{123} + S_{134} + \dots + S_{1(n - 1)n} = \frac 12 \sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1} \left ((-x_{i} y_1 + x_{i + 1} y_1 + x_1 y_{i} - x_{i + 1} y_{i} - x_1 y_{i + 1} + x_{i} y_{i + 1} ) \right )\] <p>Have you spotted it yet? Most of the terms in the above expression cancel out. \(-x_{i} y_1\) would cancel out with \(x_{i + 1} y_1\) in most of the cases, except when \(i = 2\) or \(i = n - 1\).</p> <p>Using this:</p> \[S = \frac 12 \left (-x_2 y_1 + x_n y_1 + x_1 y_2 - x_1 y_n \sum_{i = 2}^{n - 1} (- x_{i + 1} y_{i} + x_{i} y_{i + 1}) \right ) = \boxed{\frac 12 \left ( \sum_{i = 1} ^ n x_{i} y_{i + 1} - x_{i + 1} y_i \right )}\] <p>And yes, $\vec p_{n + 1} = \vec p_1$, the indices do wrap around.</p> <p>We generally don’t care about the order of the points (i.e. clockwise or anti-clockwise), so to avoid confusion, let’s put a modulus on the above expression: \(S = \boxed{\frac 12 abs \left ( \sum_{i = 1} ^ n x_{i} y_{i + 1} - x_{i + 1} y_i \right )}\)</p> <hr/> <h2 id="number-of-boundary-points">Number of boundary points</h2> <h4 id="number-of-lattice-points-between-a-point-and-the-origin">Number of lattice points between a point and the origin</h4> <p>Consider a point \(\vec p_1 = (x_1, y_1)\), we will find the number of lattice points between the origin and \(\vec p\) (exclusive of both).</p> <p>The equation of this line is \(\frac{x_1}{x} = \frac{y_1}{y}\).</p> <p>To start with, if we set the above ratio to be equal to the \(g = \gcd(x_1, y_1)\), it certainly satisfies the equation.
